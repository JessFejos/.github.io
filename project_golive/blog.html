        <h2>New projects</h2>
        <h6> March 1, 2018</h6>

        <h6>Everyday something is changing at Stevens. New initiatives and projects are launched with the goal to improve our campus. With technology at our core, we must ensure that new IT solutions meet the needs of our students, faculty, and staff. But, how can that be achieved?
        There is a common factor in achieving the intended outcomes of these initiatives: people. These projects impact the way Stevens students, faculty, and staff work every day. Consideration about how people will be impacted must be at the core of every project.  Most IT projects have less to do with the technology that is being introduced, and more about the people that technology will impact.
        Change management is the focus on preparing and supporting people through changes that affect how they do their jobs. The goal is to understand what people need to be successful, increase the adoption and usage of new technology, so projects are completed on time and provide the expected results and outcomes. Bottom line: deliver technology solutions that our users need to be successful!
        A focus on change management has been proven to positively affect the success rate of projects. As illustrated in the graph below, excellent change management has an enormous positive impact on meeting project objectives. In fact, initiatives with excellent change management are six times more likely to meet objectives than those with poor change management. For our users, this means that your needs are at the forefront of each project and we arenâ€™t successful unless those needs are met!

        <h6>The Office of User Support Services is the single point of contact for all questions and issues related to personal computing, academic and administrative systems, technology infrastructure, user training, and support needs at Stevens. Our misson is to be a first class Service Desk team that is focused on providing faculty, staff and students with resources, quality service and support that is integrated into the daily activities of the Stevens community. </h6>

    <h2>Moving your mailbox</h2>
    <h6> Jan 2, 2018</h6>
    <img src="TRAC_Nov_2017_5.jpg" alt="">
    <h6>Moving mailbox locations is a little like moving into a new house. You can move with
      everything, or you can get rid of things you don't really need anymore to make your
      move go more smoothly. Doing some 'spring cleaning' in your email account will help
      your move to Office 365 Email go more smoothly. The project team will work directly with the divisions, schools, and college at Stevens to provide additional information, including timeline and process to fully prepare you for this move.</h6>
