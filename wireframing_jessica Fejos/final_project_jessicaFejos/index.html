      About us
    </h2>
    <h6>
      The Office of Project Management (OPM) in the Division of Information
      Technology supports the successful delivery of IT projects at Stevens,
      including enterprise projects. We provide project management, business
      analysis, and change management services to aid in the implementation
      and adoption of new systems and services. In addition, the OPM liaises
      between the Division of Information Technology and the Division of Facilities
      to ensure that technology components of construction and renovation projects
      are managed and deployed successfully.

      Change management
    </h2>

    <h6>
      Everyday something is changing at Stevens. New initiatives and projects are launched
      with the goal to improve our campus. With technology at our core, we must ensure that
      new IT solutions meet the needs of our students, faculty, and staff. But, how can that
      be achieved?
    </h6>
    <h6>
      There is a common factor in achieving the intended outcomes of these initiatives: people.
      These projects impact the way Stevens students, faculty, and staff work every day. Consideration
      about how people will be impacted must be at the core of every project.  Most IT projects have l
      ess to do with the technology that is being introduced, and more about the people that technology
      will impact.
    </h6>
    <h6>
      Change management is the focus on preparing and supporting people through changes that affect how
      they do their jobs. The goal is to understand what people need to be successful, increase the adoption
      and usage of new technology, so projects are completed on time and provide the expected results and outcomes.
      Bottom line: deliver technology solutions that our users need to be successful!
    </h6>
    <h6>
      A focus on change management has been proven to positively affect the success rate of projects. As illustrated in
      the graph below, excellent change management has an enormous positive impact on meeting project objectives. In fact,
      initiatives with excellent change management are six times more likely to meet objectives than those with poor change
      management. For our users, this means that your needs are at the forefront of each project and we arenâ€™t successful unless
      those needs are met!
